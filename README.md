# composite-tuple

Tuple functions for [composite](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/composite),
inspired by
[relude](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/relude-0.7.0.0/docs/Relude-Extra-Tuple.html).

It's possible these be made to work for vinyl in general, but at the moment
they are composite-specific.
